This file contains codes and plots presented at the ML-Reco group meeting on 2024-11-27. The code used in this meeting is working perfectly fine for the reconstructed neutrino interaction vertices and the reconstrcuted tracks (total and individual) multiplicity distributions, both with and without muon-MINERvA pairing. This code still needs to be improved for plotting kinematic variables.
